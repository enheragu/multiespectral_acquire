## Dependencies

Note that due to licensing issues no conde from Pylon or Spinnaker is uploaded here. Both libraries need to be installed. 
As for pylon, autogenerated wrapper for this camera is used (generated by pylon software).


## GUI control in python with VEVN

The python venv can be created inside the workspace but needs to be ignored by colcon:
```sh
    source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    touch .venv/COLCON_IGNORE
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r /multiespectral_acquire_gui/requirements.txt
```

To activate it correctly start with generic ROS, then venv and then workspace (command as followed if the ws is in home):
```sh
    source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
    source ~/ros2_ws/venv/bin/activate
    source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```
